# Resume

After working for more than 35 years in the Telecommunications sector where I had contact with the most modern technologies such as GPON, HFC, FTTH, SDH, MetroEthernet, Mobile, VoIP etc, I started a new journey through the universe of software development. During last two years I have dedicate intensily in update skills with focus on full-stack development, cloud computing, data science, embedded systems, IoT, Blockchain and Web3 projects.

May God bless me in this fantastic trip.
